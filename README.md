# Normative modelling educational course OHBM 2024

Normative modelling has revolutionized our approach to identifying effects in neuroimaging, enabling a shift from group-level statistics to subject-level inferences. The use of extensive population data, now readily accessible, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of healthy brain development as well as our understanding of psychiatric and neurological conditions. Beyond individualized predictions, advantages of normative modelling include the transfer of predictions to unseen sites, data harmonization, and great flexibility and adaptability to various brain imaging data types and distributions. However, the considerable power of these models requires careful handling and interpretation, ideally with a profound understanding of their intricacies.
 
This course will educate attendees on the theoretical background and the fitting, use and interpretation of normative models. While the course will be taught with data provided, a strong focus will be on the transferability of skills to participants’ own data and research.

The overall objective is to provide participants with hands-on experience and tools to be able to transfer knowledge and to use normative modelling on their own data.

## Objective
- Introduction to Normative Modeling: We aim to acquaint participants with the concept of normative modelling and showcase situations where its application is both appropriate and beneficial.
- Comprehensive Understanding of Methods: We will introduce the most common normative modelling methods, providing practical insights into their implementation. This encompasses a spectrum of approaches, ranging from purely statistical to Bayesian methods, with a focus on highlighting their respective strengths and potential challenges.
- Visualization and interpretation of Results: We will guide participants in understanding and interpreting the results of the models, emphasizing their relevance in subsequent analyses. Special attention will be given to creating visualizations and to  illuminating potential limitations that participants should be aware of.
- Advanced theory and applications of normative modelling
- We will further illustrate advanced and applied uses of normative modelling. These will include:
  - Longitudinal models
  - Application to diverse brain imaging measures, such as functional connectivity and in relation with brain/body age
  - Advanced modelling approaches, such as models, such as GAMLSS and of the SHASH distribution
  - Transfer and prediction of normative modeling results to new and unseen sites and populations
