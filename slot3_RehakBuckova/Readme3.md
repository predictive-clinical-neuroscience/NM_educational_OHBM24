# Longitudinal Normative Modelling protocol for the BLR model
In this tutorial, we showcase the code for the analysis of longitudinal data using the BLR method descirbed elsewhere (see [BLR_protocol](https://github.com/bbuckova/PCNtoolkit-demo/tree/main/tutorials/BLR_protocol)).

The approach is accompanied by a [paper](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/95823) that describes the mathematics of the method in depth.
